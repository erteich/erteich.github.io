I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Complex Systems Lab at University of Pennsylvania.
I'm interested broadly in the physical mechanisms that govern self-organization on multiple length scales.
Usually, my work lies in the realm of soft matter and materials science, in which ensembles of particles or other constituents spontaneously crystallize or spectacularly fail and form glasses.
Lately, I have also been interested in structural organization in the human brain, and applying the soft matter physicist's toolkit to characterize white matter architecture.
